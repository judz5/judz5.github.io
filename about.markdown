## Hi! 

My name is Judson Salinas, and that's Winston (*to be clear I am the one on the right*). Welcome to my website, where I'll document some of my projects and share my experiences in Computer Science.

I'm currently a student at Texas A&M studying Computer Science. At the moment, I'm **very** interested in cybersecurity, specifically Networking and InfoSec. I love working with physical hacking gadgets and can't wait to share some of my recent projects. 

Some other passions of mine include cars, Runescape, guitars, music, and photography. I love to learn new things and am always looking for a new challenge. In my free time, you can often find me exploring random buildings or pondering in mysterious locations. 

Hope you enjoy my site!
