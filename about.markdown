## Hi there! 

My name is Judson Salinas, and that is Winston (*just to be clear, I am not the dog*). Welcome to my blog/portfolio page, where I'll document some of my projects and share my adventures with Computer Science.

I'm currently a student at Texas A&M studying Computer Science. At the moment I'm **very** interested in cybersecurity, specifically Networking and InfoSec. I love working with physical hacking gadgets and can't wait to share some of my recent projects.

Some other passions of mine include cars, Runescape, guitars, music, and photography. I love to learn new things and am always looking for a new challenge. In my free time, you can often find me exploring random buildings or pondering in mysterious locations. 

Hope you enjoy my site!
